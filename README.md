Why this problem statement?

Why not Manpowered inspection?

-Work long hours- lead to fatigue and stress
-Hangar personnel are often exposed to hazardous materials, such as fuel, solvents, and paint fumes.
-More decision time, yet error prone.
-Average salary of a hangar personnel $57,460 per year
-Many employees for single inspection. 

Even to this day, visual inspection by airport ground crew is still the most widely used approach for aircraft skin inspection. Nevertheless, human visual inspection has potential problems and deficiencies. First, because the visual inspection of a civil aircraft usually includes 21 position points from the nose to the tail of the aircraft and more than 100 inspection items,3 human visual inspection is time-consuming and inefficient. Second, the results of visual inspection are easily affected by subjective factors of the inspector, for example, fine cracks may not be detected because of inspector fatigue or boredom. Third, several objective factors, such as bad weather or excessively high or low temperature, also reduce the efficiency and accuracy of human visual inspection. Finally, skin inspection of several specific regions at high locations of the aircraft may risk the safety of the inspectors.

Why Drone Technology?

-Reduction of inspection time and AOG time
-Reduction of safety incidents and PPE related costs
-Reduction of decision time
-Objective damage assessment and reduction of human error
-Augmentation of Novices Skills


Drone Inspection Process:

The drone inspection process involves several steps. First, the drone is deployed to the designated area. It captures high-definition images of the aircraft's exterior using its onboard camera. These images are then analyzed using computer vision algorithms to detect and classify skin defects. Finally, the inspection results are generated, providing detailed reports and recommendations for necessary repairs or maintenance.


Cost-Effectiveness:

Traditional inspection methods - expensive equipment and manpower.
Average salary of a hangar personnel $57,460 per year
Drones -initial investment is outweighed by the long-term cost-effectiveness and improved safety outcomes.
the DJI Mini 3 offers a 4K camera, compact, lightweight build. Price $500.
Code costs ZERO investment!


Challenges and Limitations:

Weather conditions can affect the efficiency and effectiveness of drone inspections. 
Require human expertise to ensure accuracy.
Lighting constraints.


Future Developments:

The future of aircraft inspections lies in continuous advancements in drone technology. Innovations such as autonomous drones, advanced sensors, and artificial intelligence algorithms will further enhance the accuracy and efficiency of inspections. Integration with big data analytics and predictive maintenance systems will enable proactive defect detection and prevention. Embracing these future developments will revolutionize the way we ensure aircraft safety and maintenance.


Conclusion:

In conclusion, the utilization of drone technology for comprehensive visual inspection of aircraft skin defects offers numerous benefits, including enhanced safety, cost-effectiveness, and improved efficiency. Despite challenges and limitations, the industry's increasing adoption of drones reflects the confidence in their effectiveness. Embracing future developments will further revolutionize aircraft inspections, ensuring a secure and reliable aviation industry.
